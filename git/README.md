# git Module Instructions

## WSL2 Usage

- The module assumes that a recent version of Git has been installed on the host Windows System
 - This assumption includes the fact that later version of Git on windows come with the `git-credential-manager` included
 - Otherwise, it will need installing and configuring separately [here](https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager/blob/release/docs/install.md)
