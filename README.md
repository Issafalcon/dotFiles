# Issafalcon dotfiles

> Modular installation of terminal, and terminal tools with my personal config files
> Inspired by [`caarlos0 dotFiles setup`](https://github.com/caarlos0/dotfiles)

The goals of my dotFiles are as follows:
 1. Replace default shell with zsh, adding useful plugins without compromising speed
 2. Create modular installation options for remaining dotfiles
 3. Allow customization and extensibility

## Installation

### Setup and prerequisites intallation

The following will install some prerequisite files onto your machine (requires `sudo`)
e.g. Homebrew, git, curl, wget etc.

It will quickly replace the default shell with zsh and add plugins using zinit.

The default theme is powerline10k (you can change this)

These prerequisites may change as I evolve this repo.

> IMPORTANT: Clone to the ~/dotFiles directory as this will become the default stow directory (this can of course be modified)

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/Issafalcon/dotFiles.git ~/.dotFiles
$ cd ~/dotFiles
$ ./prerequisites.sh 
$ zsh
```

Zinit plugins will be installed and you will need to restart your terminal to be taken to
powerline10k configuration wizard.

It is recommended that you install a NerdFont compatible font prior to setting up powerline10k.

### Module Installation

Modules are installed via two scripts in the root directory:
- `./bootstrap.sh`
- `./bootstrap_bulk.sh`

Module names match the names of the top level subdirectories in the repo (except `docs` and `.git`)

#### Individual Modules

To "install" a module run the following:

```console
$ ./bootstrap.sh -m <MODULE_NAME> -i
```
> Or, if you don't want to install the actual dependencies for the module (you may have them installed already)

```console
$ ./bootstrap.sh -m <MODULE_NAME>
```
#### Bulk Install Modules

To install multiple modules at once (or all of them), run the following:

```console
$ ./bootstrap_bulk.sh.sh -i [...MODULE_NAMES] # Where <MODULE_NAMES> is a space separated list of modules
```
> Or, if you don't want to install the actual dependencies for the module (you may have them installed already)

```console
$ ./bootstrap.sh -m [...MODULE_NAMES]
```

At the moment, I am not accepting PRs, but please feel free to open issues or add suggestions for improvements,
so that setup can be made more accessible.
